# Step 1: Read input values
N, K = map(int, input().split())
words = input().split()

# Step 2: Create a dictionary to store word frequencies
word_frequency = {}

# Step 3: Iterate through words and update frequencies
for word in words:
    word_frequency[word] = word_frequency.get(word, 0) + 1

# Step 4: Create a list of tuples (word, frequency)
word_frequency_list = [(word, freq) for word, freq in word_frequency.items()]

# Step 5: Sort the list first by frequency (descending), then by lexicographical order
word_frequency_list.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))

# Step 6: Extract the first K words and print them
for i in range(K):
    print(word_frequency_list[i][0], end=' ')
